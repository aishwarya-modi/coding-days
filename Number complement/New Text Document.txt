Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.
Input: num = 5
Output: 2

Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.


Input: num = 1
Output: 0
